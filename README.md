## 👋 Welcome!
Welcome to the first Local Government Innovation Hackathon. We're excited to have you join us for a 48-hour collaboration and initiative that supports a '[blueprint for modern digital government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government)'.

This Hackathon is being organised by [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) (GDS) and the [Incubator for AI](https://ai.gov.uk/) (i.AI), in partnership with the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government Digital Planning programme](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/digital-planning/) and [Open Digital Planning](https://opendigitalplanning.org/).

Planning reform is key to economic growth and digital transformation can make it happen. This is your chance to work directly with i.AI engineers, technical and planning experts to build solutions that could shape the future of public services.

This document contains everything you need to know to help you make the most of your hackathon experience.

## 🎯 Challenge information

Through feedback you have shared and wider engagement with stakeholders we have identified five key challenge areas within the planning system which will form the focus of our two-day hackathon. We're seeking innovative solutions to address these complex issues.

During the hackathon, you'll work in multi-disciplinary teams focused on a specific problem statement, with facilitators, mentors and experts available to guide you through the process.  

To help us allocate you to an area that matches your interests and expertise, please [take a look at the problem statements and complete this form, by 25 April,](https://forms.office.com/e/Dr0XbtKtqm) and rank the problem statements you'd most like to work on, in order of preference.  While we'll do our best to assign you to your preferred area, please note that we also need to create balanced teams across all the challenge areas. 

Please complete the form before the event. If you haven't managed to do this in advance we will allocate you into a multi-disciplinary team.
