As a quick start, here's a high level overview of what Large Language Models (LLMs) can do:

| Capability | Description | Potential Planning Applications |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **📄 Document Processing** | LLMs can extract information from PDFs, forms, and scanned documents, converting unstructured data to structured formats | • Digitizing historical planning records<br>• Automating planning application intake<br>• Extracting key metrics from lengthy policy documents |
| **🎙️ Transcription & Analysis** | Models can transcribe audio from meetings and consultations, then analyze the content for key themes | • Making public planning meetings more accessible<br>• Identifying common concerns in community consultations<br>• Creating searchable archives of planning discussions |
| **✅ Document Verification & Assessment** | LLMs can cross-reference information across multiple sources to verify accuracy and consistency, and evaluate documents against predefined criteria, standards, or checklists to ensure compliance | • Validating planning applications against local policies<br>• Checking infrastructure capacity reports<br>• Ensuring housing forecasts align with demographic data<br>• Screening planning applications for completeness<br>• Assessing development proposals against sustainability criteria<br>• Checking housing designs against accessibility standards |
| **💬 Document Chat & Search** | LLMs can allow natural language conversations with document collections, enabling intuitive information retrieval | • Creating searchable planning policy assistants<br>• Enabling planners to query historical application databases<br>• Helping citizens navigate complex planning documentation |
| **📊 Consultation Analysis** | LLMs can process large volumes of public consultation responses to identify themes, sentiment, and key issues as well as redacting sensitive information | • Summarizing feedback from community engagement events<br>• Identifying recurring concerns across multiple consultations<br>• Categorizing stakeholder priorities for planning decisions<br>• Tracking sentiment changes over multiple consultation phases |
| **🔄 Multimodal Reasoning** | Advanced models like GPT-4o and Claude 3 can go beyond just across text to use images and data to solve complex problems | • Balancing housing needs with infrastructure constraints<br>• Visualizing planning scenarios for public engagement<br>• Predicting impacts of development on local communities |
| **👁️ Visual Understanding** | Modern LLMs like Claude and Gemini can analyze images, identify objects, and understand spatial relationships such as where items are within images | • Automated review of planning application drawings<br>• Identifying non-compliant elements in building designs<br>• Analyzing satellite imagery for land use changes |
| **💻 Code Generation** | LLMs can write code to automate workflows, analyze data, and create interactive tools | • Building custom planning process automation tools<br>• Creating data pipelines for housing demand forecasting<br>• Developing interactive public engagement platforms |
| **🧩 Reasoning & Planning** | LLMs can break down complex problems into logical steps, identify dependencies, and create structured plans | • Developing phased implementation strategies for housing projects<br>• Identifying critical path dependencies in infrastructure planning<br>• Creating decision trees for planning application assessment |
| **🔧 Tool Use** | LLMs can interact with external tools like calculators, databases, and APIs to extend their capabilities beyond text generation | • Querying planning databases to retrieve relevant precedents<br>• Performing complex calculations for infrastructure capacity assessments<br>• Accessing GIS systems to analyze spatial data for development proposals |
| **🔍 Research & Information Retrieval** | Models can use search through documents, websites, and databases to find relevant information and synthesize findings | • Gathering precedents from similar planning cases<br>• Researching best practices in sustainable urban development<br>• Compiling evidence for policy recommendations |
