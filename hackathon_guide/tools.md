## ‚ú® Large Language Model Capabilities

**üß™ AI Expertise Available!**

During the hackathon, AI experts from the [Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI)](https://ai.gov.uk/) will be present to provide guidance and support. These specialists can help you:

- Understand what's possible with current AI technologies
- Identify the most suitable models for your specific use case
- Troubleshoot technical issues with model implementation
- Advise on prompt engineering and fine-tuning
- Explain how to effectively combine AI with other tools and datasets
- Share best practices for responsible AI use in public sector applications

Don't hesitate to approach these experts throughout the event - they're here to help you maximize the potential of AI in your solutions!

As a quick start, here's a high level overview of what Large Language Models (LLMs) can do:

| Capability | Description | Potential Planning Applications |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **üìÑ Document Processing** | LLMs can extract information from PDFs, forms, and scanned documents, converting unstructured data to structured formats | ‚Ä¢ Digitizing historical planning records<br>‚Ä¢ Automating planning application intake<br>‚Ä¢ Extracting key metrics from lengthy policy documents |
| **üéôÔ∏è Transcription & Analysis** | Models can transcribe audio from meetings and consultations, then analyze the content for key themes | ‚Ä¢ Making public planning meetings more accessible<br>‚Ä¢ Identifying common concerns in community consultations<br>‚Ä¢ Creating searchable archives of planning discussions |
| **‚úÖ Document Verification & Assessment** | LLMs can cross-reference information across multiple sources to verify accuracy and consistency, and evaluate documents against predefined criteria, standards, or checklists to ensure compliance | ‚Ä¢ Validating planning applications against local policies<br>‚Ä¢ Checking infrastructure capacity reports<br>‚Ä¢ Ensuring housing forecasts align with demographic data<br>‚Ä¢ Screening planning applications for completeness<br>‚Ä¢ Assessing development proposals against sustainability criteria<br>‚Ä¢ Checking housing designs against accessibility standards |
| **üí¨ Document Chat & Search** | LLMs can allow natural language conversations with document collections, enabling intuitive information retrieval | ‚Ä¢ Creating searchable planning policy assistants<br>‚Ä¢ Enabling planners to query historical application databases<br>‚Ä¢ Helping citizens navigate complex planning documentation |
| **üìä Consultation Analysis** | LLMs can process large volumes of public consultation responses to identify themes, sentiment, and key issues as well as redacting sensitive information | ‚Ä¢ Summarizing feedback from community engagement events<br>‚Ä¢ Identifying recurring concerns across multiple consultations<br>‚Ä¢ Categorizing stakeholder priorities for planning decisions<br>‚Ä¢ Tracking sentiment changes over multiple consultation phases |
| **üîÑ Multimodal Reasoning** | Advanced models like GPT-4o and Claude 3 can go beyond just across text to use images and data to solve complex problems | ‚Ä¢ Balancing housing needs with infrastructure constraints<br>‚Ä¢ Visualizing planning scenarios for public engagement<br>‚Ä¢ Predicting impacts of development on local communities |
| **üëÅÔ∏è Visual Understanding** | Modern LLMs like Claude and Gemini can analyze images, identify objects, and understand spatial relationships such as where items are within images | ‚Ä¢ Automated review of planning application drawings<br>‚Ä¢ Identifying non-compliant elements in building designs<br>‚Ä¢ Analyzing satellite imagery for land use changes |
| **üíª Code Generation** | LLMs can write code to automate workflows, analyze data, and create interactive tools | ‚Ä¢ Building custom planning process automation tools<br>‚Ä¢ Creating data pipelines for housing demand forecasting<br>‚Ä¢ Developing interactive public engagement platforms |
| **üß© Reasoning & Planning** | LLMs can break down complex problems into logical steps, identify dependencies, and create structured plans | ‚Ä¢ Developing phased implementation strategies for housing projects<br>‚Ä¢ Identifying critical path dependencies in infrastructure planning<br>‚Ä¢ Creating decision trees for planning application assessment |
| **üîß Tool Use** | LLMs can interact with external tools like calculators, databases, and APIs to extend their capabilities beyond text generation | ‚Ä¢ Querying planning databases to retrieve relevant precedents<br>‚Ä¢ Performing complex calculations for infrastructure capacity assessments<br>‚Ä¢ Accessing GIS systems to analyze spatial data for development proposals |
| **üîç Research & Information Retrieval** | Models can use search through documents, websites, and databases to find relevant information and synthesize findings | ‚Ä¢ Gathering precedents from similar planning cases<br>‚Ä¢ Researching best practices in sustainable urban development<br>‚Ä¢ Compiling evidence for policy recommendations |
