# üìä Local Gov Hack: Datasets

## üóÉÔ∏è Available Datasets

> There are many open datasets available on the internet for planning and local government. We have provided a list of some resources we think are very useful and great places to start. However, you are free to search and find any other datasets you might need for your solution.


### üåü Key Datasets

#### [Planning Data](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/)

Comprehensive API with land and housing datasets across England. This open platform collects and standardizes planning data from various sources, allowing anyone to view, build services, or analyze the data. Making this data more accessible aims to improve planning decisions, reduce delays, enable new digital services, and enhance community-development relationships.

#### [Planning London Datahub](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/digital-planning/planning-london-datahub)
London-specific planning application data with detailed insights into residential developments across boroughs. Contains information on approval status, unit counts, construction progress, location data, application types, and timeline milestones.

For the hackathon, we would love to see analyses on borough housing trends, construction progress tracking, approval-to-completion timelines, future delivery predictions, application success rates, stalled development identification, and historical pattern insights.
